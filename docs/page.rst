JSON view of a profile page
===========================

The JSON view of the profile, ``profile.json`` in the *profile*
context, returns the profile information to people who are logged
in. It is used by the ``gs.group.member.export`` system to
produce a CSV of profile information for the group members.

:See also: The ``gs.search.people`` product allows external
           systems to get a JSON view of a profile
           <https://github.com/groupserver/gs.search.people>
